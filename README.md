Why the Grateful Dead?

"The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes." ~ WIkipedia

A suplus of audio is available making allowing music to freely fill the air.

"Ripple in still water, When there is no pebble tossed, 
Nor wind to blow." - Robert Hunter
